At the scheme, you can see:

I made debounce circuit for the button, instead to software debounce. I did this because i was not sure if the software debounce will not
influence the delay between press and flashing.
I used this calculator to calculate the circuit:

I added secondary LED to indicate end of the procedure and resetting part of the code.

There are also 4 pins for the board to reprogram it easily with arduino in case i would like to make some changes, which i will.

What can be done to improve the procedure:

Let say, you have 15 basic rounds which will be added to some random rounds and you get 23 normal rounds, where the delay is longer.
I am thinking about improving the code, in which you start with few rounds with 80ms delay and then go to 150ms or even 200ms with
proportional increments, so you get "reprogrammed" even more.

I will try to implement some code which will put the device on rest if you forget to turn it off and you are not using it for some time.

then you get your 5 last round which will be with very short delay.

About the fast rounds:
I noticed, that i feel only the first one to be weird. Next ones are less obvious, i think it is because my brain is "reprogramming" itself
to the short delay.
